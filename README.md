# homelight_prompt

## Prompt:
HomeLight refers clients to Real Estate Agents, and collects a percentage of the agent commissions if the client ends up closing a real estate transaction with the agent.
Design an operational flow using AI tools that exist today to do the following: 
(1) Identify if the referral closed with that agent, 
(2) Inform the agent about collections, and 
(3) Actually collect on the commission amount.
-> Note:
Please showcase process flows and types of tools/platforms you would use to construct this.
Any sort of prototypes using AI Agents highly encouraged.
Spend no more than 2 hours on this assignment.
